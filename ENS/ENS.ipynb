    "**FAQ:** Why only top 50? <br>\n",
    "<code>#</code>It is not hard-coded. One can provide a list of as many delegates as they want to the script. At the current moment however, top 50 delegates combine to make up just over 68% of the total voting power of ENS DAO. This is sufficient to achieve super-majority. It makes sense to make the cut-off at 50 at the time being."
